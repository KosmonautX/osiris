Title: 'Unit Labour Cost Index (Base Year 2015 = 100), Quarterly, (SA)'
Description: 'Unit Labour Cost is defined as the average cost of labour per unit of
  real output. Total labour cost consists of compensation of employees received by
  the employee, labour income of the self-employed, other labour-related costs (e.g.
  Foreign Worker Levy and net training cost) incurred by the employers and wage subsidies
  (e.g. Wage Credit Scheme and Jobs Credit Scheme) that are provided to the employers.
  Wage subsides reduce labour costs to the employers and are netted off from total
  labour cost.'
