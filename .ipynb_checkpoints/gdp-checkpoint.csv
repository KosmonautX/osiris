"Disaggregated chain-linked data generally do not add up to the total. Advance estimates for GDP in chained (2015) dollars are available at www.singstat.gov.sg/advgdp. The advance GDP estimates are computed largely from data in the first two months of the quarter (e.g. 1st Quarter is based on Jan and Feb; 2nd Quarter is based on Apr and May). They are intended as an early indication of the GDP growth in the quarter, and are subjected to revision when more comprehensive data become available.
